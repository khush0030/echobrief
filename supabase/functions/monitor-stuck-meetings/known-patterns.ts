/**
 * Known error signatures the monitor recognizes.
 *
 * Source of truth for the human-readable runbook is `/errors.md`. This file is
 * the programmatic mirror — when adding a new entry to errors.md, also add the
 * signature here with the appropriate recovery action.
 *
 * If the monitor encounters a signature NOT in this set, it logs to
 * `monitor_events` with `is_new_pattern = true` and emails amaan@oltaflock.ai
 * so the new pattern can be investigated and added.
